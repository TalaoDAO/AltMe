      "que": "Why is Talao called a Universal wallet and why is it different from other digital wallets ?",
      "ans": "Talao is called a 'Universal wallet' because just like a physical wallet in which you can carry your ID cards and funds, you can use the Talao wallet to gather digital credentials (Identity card, Age range proof, diploma, etc.) and digital assets (Cryptos, NFTs, tokens...).

With SSI, users are able to store, manage and share their personal data in a decentralize manner, enabling greater privacy and security. SSI also uses Zero-Knowledge Proof and 'Selective Disclosure' to protect users privacy."

      "ans": "When you receive a verifiable credential in the Talao wallet, it is added to your digital identity. You can then use this credential to prove your identity or access certain services. For example, you might use a membership credential to access a members-only area of a website, or an 'Over 18' proof to access a DeFi application. You can use the “scan” button in Talao to share credentials when it is requested. It’s super easy. Just scan the QR code, and accept the request to share your digital credentials."

      "ans": "No there is zero risk.&nbsp;You don’t need to share or disclose any passphrase or private keys to get a proof of ownership. All you have to do is scan a QR code with your favorite crypto wallet (address) in order to get the credential that proves you hold the private key of this address. Talao wallet is never connected your crypto wallet."

    {
      "que": "How do I backup my keys and credentials in Talao ?",

    },
    {
      "que": "What are Verifiable Credentials and why is it useful ?",
      "ans": "Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are an open standard for digital claims. They can represent information such as identity card, an Over 18 Proof or a proof of ownership of a crypto address. They have many advantages, including the fact that they are digitally signed, making them tamper-proof, extremely secure and instantly verifiable by a third-party."
    },
    {
      "que": "What is 'elective disclosure' ?",
      "ans": "Selective disclosure is a way for SSI users to reveal certain pieces of information about their identity, without disclosing sensitive information.
