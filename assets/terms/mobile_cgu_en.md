## Presentation of the Service

The COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET is a non-custodial wallet software meticulously designed for managing Verifiable Credentials and Digital Assets. These Digital Assets encompass cryptocurrencies (coins) and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). As a non-custodial wallet software, users enjoy complete control and responsibility over their personal data, digital assets, and private keys, enabling them to authorize transactions from their wallet address.

The "COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET" Application provides Users access to a wide range of Services, which include:

1. **Collecting Credentials**: Users can collect Credentials from various partner third-party issuers, including Compellio and other third-party companies or organizations.  
     
2. **Storing Credentials**: Users have the capability to securely store their collected Credentials throughout their validity period.  
     
3. **Presenting/Sharing Credentials**: Users can share their Credentials with third-party websites or applications that require verification for access to their services.

Other parties (verifiers) can initiate identity requests to you through existing peer-to-peer connections. These requests come pre-filled with identity credentials already stored in the app. You have the option to manually update this information if additional relevant identity attributes are available. Upon your active consent to share this information, the selected identity credentials are transmitted to the requesting party.

The responsibility for storing your data lies with the requesting party, and they are accountable for legally compliant data handling. Compellio SA assumes no responsibilities or obligations in this regard. The role of the COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET is limited to facilitating the exchange of information among participants. If the requested identity information is not found within the app, you will receive an appropriate error message. The missing identity information must first be provided to you by another participant before the request can be fulfilled.

In cases where you choose not to respond to an identity request, you have the option to reject it. In such instances, no information will be shared with the requesting party.

Upon successful completion of credential requests, you will receive a confirmation message.

### Wallet Creation

To use the COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET, you must either import an existing wallet or create a new one. When you create a wallet, you'll receive a Recovery Phrase. It's your responsibility to promptly notify us of any unauthorized use of your Recovery Phrase, private keys, or any other security breaches related to your wallet. You acknowledge and agree that you assume all risks associated with using our services and are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Recovery Phrase and private keys.

When creating a wallet, we strongly recommend taking precautionary measures to prevent any loss of access or control over your wallet. These precautions may include, but are not limited to:

* Creating a strong and unique PIN Code, distinct from PIN Code used for other purposes (e.g., different from your phone PIN Code or PIN Code used on websites or online services), and utilizing biometric authentication if available.  
* Avoiding the storage of private keys and the Recovery Phrase in plain text online or in insecure physical locations.  
* Restricting access to your devices and wallet.  
* Taking necessary precautions against malware on your devices and networks.  
* Promptly notifying us if you discover or suspect any security breaches related to your wallet.

However, Compellio SA holds no liability for any activities occurring on your wallet, whether authorized by you or not.

Key features and functionalities of the COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET include:

* Generating a Decentralized Identifier (DID).  
* Collecting Credentials (Verifiable Credentials).  
* Securely Storing Credentials.  
* Transferring Credentials to Third-Party Verifiers.  
* Secure online connection to decentralised Applications (dApps): Particularly within the realm of web3 applications, such as accessing decentralized crypto games, NFT marketplaces, Metaverse platforms, and Decentralized Finance applications.  
* Generating Wallet Addresses and Associated Private Keys: For seamless sending and receiving of digital assets.  
* Swapping/Trading Digital Assets: Via DApps offered by third-party service providers.  
* Viewing Digital Asset Price Information: As provided by third-party service providers.  
* Broadcasting Digital Asset Transaction Data: To various supported blockchains by COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET, without requiring users to download or install associated blockchain-based software on their local devices.

COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET’s service is underpinned by innovative technologies, including Blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). It empowers users to maintain their digital identity on their smartphones, eliminating the need to store their data on identity provider servers.

User data is securely stored, either encrypted within the wallet or optionally encrypted on a server for recovery purposes. Users maintain exclusive access to their data and have the flexibility to transfer it to third parties for accessing services. Additionally, users are the sole entities authorized to collect data from organizations.

In essence, this wallet serves as an online rendition of the traditional wallet, housing both payment methods and personal information, all within the user's control.

### How the Service Works to Share Credentials

1°) Connection to a Third-party Site or Application from a Computer:

To accomplish this, follow these steps:

* Click on the "COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET" button on the third-party site, which will redirect you to the compellio.com site, presenting a QR code for scanning.  
* Open the previously downloaded Application in compliance with the T\&C.  
* Utilize the QR code scanning feature within the Application.  
* Scan the QR code displayed on the website or application.  
* Review the Credential requested by the third-party site and decide whether to accept or refuse sharing.  
* If accepted, validate the sharing by entering your secret code.  
* Receive a success message upon successful sharing.  
* Encounter an error message if sharing fails, with the option to retry the operation.  
* If you refuse, the Credential cannot be shared with the website or application, preventing transmission to the requesting third-party site, and the operation terminates.  
* Entering an incorrect secret code three (3) times when sharing a Credential will result in your Wallet being blocked. You will be prompted to delete your Wallet and create a new one following the steps described in these T\&C.

2°) Connection to a Third-party Site or Application from a Mobile or Tablet:

If you access the compellio.com site from a mobile or tablet, you will encounter an "open the application" or "download the application" button instead of a QR Code.

* If the Application is already installed on your mobile/tablet, click the "open the application" button. This will open the Application and indicate the required Credential, which can be shared as previously detailed.  
* If the Application is not yet installed on your mobile/tablet, click the "download the application" button. You will be redirected to the Apple "App Store" or Google "Play Store" to download the Application. After downloading the Application and creating your Wallet in accordance with these T\&C, you can share the stored Credential as described earlier.

### Digital Asset Transactions

Confirmation via Blockchain:

In order for all proposed digital asset transactions to reach their finality, they must undergo confirmation and recording on the associated blockchain. These blockchains operate as decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties that are neither owned, controlled, nor operated by Compellio SA. It's important to note that COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET has no influence or control over these blockchain networks, and therefore, cannot assure that transaction details submitted by users through COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET services will always be confirmed and processed promptly. By choosing to use the COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET, the user explicitly acknowledges and agrees to the following:

* Compellio SA lacks the ability to cancel or modify the user's transaction once initiated.  
* Transaction details submitted by the user may encounter delays or, in some cases, may not be completed on the relevant blockchain networks.  
* Compellio neither stores, sends, nor receives Digital Assets, acting solely as a facilitator.  
* All transfers of Digital Assets are conducted exclusively on the respective blockchain networks and not on any network owned by Compellio SA. Consequently, Compellio SA does not provide any guarantee regarding the transfer of title or rights to any digital asset.

### Buying Digital Assets with Credit or Debit Cards

Age Restriction: This service is exclusively available to users aged 18 and above. When the user utilizes the Compellio Wallet to purchase digital assets using their credit or debit card, a third party will convert the chosen amount into the applicable Digital Asset and credit it to the user's wallet. It's important for the user to acknowledge and agree to the following:

* Compellio is not responsible for the user's use of such third-party services and bears no liability related to the user's usage of these services.  
* The user will be subject to any terms and conditions imposed by the relevant third-party service provider.  
* Compellio cannot alter, withdraw, or cancel any conversion requests made by the user.  
* Compellio is not responsible for the exchange rates offered by the relevant third-party service provider(s).  
* Compellio is not responsible for any fees charged by the relevant third-party service provider(s) or the user's bank or credit card issuer(s).

Compellio SA does not actively monitor the NFTs and NFT Content stored on COMPELLIO DIGITAL DATA WALLET for any infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights.

As such, Compellio SA assumes no liability for any action regarding any content provided by the user. The user further acknowledges and agrees that it is their sole responsibility to conduct all necessary due diligence for all their activities related to NFTs. The user represents and warrants that they have not relied on, and shall have no remedies in respect of, any statement or representation made by Compellio SA in relation to any transfer or interaction with any NFTs.
