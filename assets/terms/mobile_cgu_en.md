## Presentation of the Professional Digital Identity service


The Profession Digital Identity is a service from Talao that allows you to create an electronic identity that can be used online via a secure mobile application. This Professional Digital Identity will be used by the user to simplify and secure his online procedures with partners, in particular in the field of human resources (e.g. access a recruitment announcement site, access his company's HR site, provide an employer certificate for renting real estate or opening a bank account, etc.). 


The service is built on 2 digital applications: the portfolio and the wallet. The wallet allows you to generate your identifier, collect certificates from third parties, store them and transfer them to other third parties. The portfolio allows a user to ask third-party companies to issue him certificates but also to keep these certificates on an external server to possibly be able to recover them in the event of loss of his smartphone or to expose them to a chosen audience. . The portfolio is a kind of digital safe whose data is accessible under the exclusive control of the user.


Talao's service is built on the basis of innovative technology (Blockchain) and the concepts of self-sovereign identity and verifiable attestations. The talao service allows a user to have a Digital Identity and certificates certified by third parties without having to save their personal data on the servers of an Identity Provider. The data is stored in the user's wallet (smartphone application) or possibly encrypted on a decentralized network. The user alone retains access to his identity with his smartphone or cryptographic keys are kept. It can authorize an application of a partner (a service provider) to access it.


As part of the Talao Professional Digital Identity service, the user benefits from various functionalities relating to his professional career. Some of these features are only accessible through their smartphone wallet.


When registering, the user must complete the Registration form available on the site (including, in particular, title, surnames and first names, e-mail address and possibly his mobile phone number.).


The user guarantees that the information he transmits is accurate, sincere and up to date. If this information should prove to be false, incomplete or obsolete, Talao reserves the right to refuse the Registration and / or to interrupt the provision of the service in accordance with the stipulations of article 14 "Termination". 


In case of modification of his personal details, the user undertakes to update them on his Professional Digital Identity profile management page.


In any case, whatever the methods of Registration of the user, the information concerning him will be treated in accordance with the charter of management of personal data (Data protection) accessible directly from the site https: // talao. co.


The user authorizes the Talao Professional Digital Identity service to transmit to partner sites, by computer processing, the information necessary for the recognition and use of his Digital Identity on the sites and services of said partners.


### Creation of a Professional Digital Identity


The creation procedure comprises 2 steps to finalize the registration procedure. The first step is to create your ID using your smartphone wallet, the second is to create a portfolio on the Talao site associated with your ID.


* The user connects to the site https://talao.co with his Desktop or his smartphone and is invited to download his wallet on his smartphone. By starting his wallet, the user is required to accept the Terms & Conditions (this document) then generate or retrieve his decentralized identifier (DID). In the event that the user decides to generate a new identifier, he is invited to copy the 12-word recovery sentence of regeneration of his identifier in the event of loss of his smartphone


* Verification of the e-mail address: Prior to the User registration for the Professional Digital Identity Service, Talao verifies the user's email address by sending an email containing a secret code. The user will be invited to obtain a first certificate proving his email (“EmailPass”) by connecting to the address https://talao.co/emailpass and giving his email then scanning a QR code. If the user has not confirmed the random code, the user is invited to restart the process to obtain this first certificate. Other methods of validating the user's email may be proposed.


* Once this certificate has been obtained, the user can create his portfolio (“create an account”) by scanning the QR code displayed on his desktop or by clicking on the link in his browser on his smartphone. The site detects if the identifier of its wallet is that of an already existing portfolio if this is not the case the site proposes to create a new portfolio for this identifier by asking the user to indicate his name and his first name.


* Verification of the decentralized identifier (DID) of the wallet: after scanning the QR code the user is invited to accept talao's access to his wallet and to present his email certificate (EmailPass). If the signature of this attestation is not recognized, the user is invited to start the process again. 


* Creation and deployment of the portfolio: the site deploys the workspace. The user receives a user name by email for a possible connection without a smartphone. By default the password will be “identity” and in this case a random code will be systematically sent by email as a secondary authentication factor. However, we recommend that the user use the connection by smartphone (QR code or link) which is simpler, faster and more secure.


### Deletion


The user who wishes to delete his portfolio must access the “Delete the portfolio appearing in his workspace” tab. A window opens to ask the user to confirm their choice with their password. In case of confirmation, the user's portfolio is permanently deleted, but on the other hand they keep their username and certificates on their wallet.


The deletion of the wallet identifier can be carried out by resetting the wallet or by uninstalling it from the smartphone. In this case its identifier is lost but possibly regenerable with the regeneration sentence. However, the certificates will be permanently lost.
